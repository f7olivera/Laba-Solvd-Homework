Execution by elephant

Execution by elephant was a method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian
elephants were used to crush, dismember or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained to kill
victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants
were used to signify both the ruler power of life and death over his subjects and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives was recorded in contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia by European
travellers. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European colonial powers that colonised the region in the 18th
and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally used by Western and African powers,
such as Ancient Rome and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.
